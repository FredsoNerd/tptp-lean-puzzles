% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Knowheyans are not negative by nature; it is just that their way
%            of expressing themselves, using negative sentences, makes it
%            appear that way. Several fortunate visitors have an opportunity
%            to attend the Midseason Art Fair, in which they are able to
%            observe a variety of Knowheyans art forms. An artists' competition
%            was held as part of the fair and awards were given for the top
%            four entries, which were collage painting, holography, laser
%            etchings, and reconstituted materials sculpture. The interpreter
%            is explaining the results of the competition to the visitors:
%            1. A, who was not the first-place winner, did not enter a
%               holograph.
%            2. The fourth-place winner did not enter a sculpture or a
%               holograph.
%            3. The one who entered the collage painting, who was neither A
%               nor C, did not win first or second place.
%            4. Neither B, nor the one who entered the laser etching, was the
%               fourth-place winner.
%            5. The third-place winner was neither B nor C.
%            6. The one who entered the laser etching, who was not A, was not
%               the second place winner.
%            In what order did they finish?
