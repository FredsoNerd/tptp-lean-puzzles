% Problem  : The Knowheyan Job Puzzle - Ages
% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Five Knowheyans, A, B, C, D, and E, work in Metropolisas Airfoil
%            Technician, Communications Consultant, Space Planner, Lunar Energy
%            Engineer, and Synthetic Food Nutrionist. No two of them are the
%            same age. The Knowheyan interpreter explains about the jobs and
%            ages of these five inhabitants, as follows:
%            1. The Communications Consultant is not younger than any of the
%               other four.
%            2. D is not as old as A and not as young as B, who is not as old
%               as the Lunar Energy Engineer, but not as young as C.
%            3. The Airfoil Technician is not younger than the Space Planner,
%               who is not younger than the Synthetic Food Nutrionist.
%            4. C is not the yougest of the five.
%            What is the age order of the five Knowheyans?
